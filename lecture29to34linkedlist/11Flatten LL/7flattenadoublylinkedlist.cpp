// You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.

// Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.

// Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
// Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
// Explanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.
// After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:

// Example 2:


// Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
// Output: [1,3,2]
// Explanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.
// After flattening the multilevel linked list/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node prev;
    public Node next;
    public Node child;
Basic idea is straight forward:
1.Start form the head , move one step each time to the next node
2.When meet with a node with child, say node p, follow its child chain to the end and connect 3.the tail node with p.next, by doing this we merged the child chain back to the main thread
4.Return to p and proceed until find next node with child.
5.Repeat until reach null

class Solution {
    public Node flatten(Node head) {
        if( head == null) return head;
	// Pointer
        Node p = head; 
        while( p!= null) {
            /* CASE 1: if no child, proceed */
            if( p.child == null ) {
                p = p.next;
                continue;
            }
            /* CASE 2: got child, find the tail of the child and link it to p.next */
            Node temp = p.child;
            // Find the tail of the child
            while( temp.next != null ) 
                temp = temp.next;
            // Connect tail with p.next, if it is not null
            temp.next = p.next;  
            if( p.next != null )  p.next.prev = temp;
            // Connect p with p.child, and remove p.child
            p.next = p.child; 
            p.child.prev = p;
            p.child = null;
        }
        return head;
    }
} it becomes:

// Example 3:

// Input: head = []
// Output: []
